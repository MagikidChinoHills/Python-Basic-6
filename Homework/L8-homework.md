# **Homework 8: Dictionaries and Sets in Python**

## **Overview**
This homework will strengthen your understanding of **dictionaries** (key-value pairs) and **sets** (unique elements) in Python. You’ll answer both **theoretical** questions about these data structures and tackle **practical** coding tasks to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.

---

## **Part A: Theory Questions**

1. **Dictionaries vs. Sets**  
   - In your own words, **compare** how dictionaries and sets differ in structure and usage.  
   - Give **one example** where a dictionary is most suitable and another example where a set is more appropriate.

2. **Dictionary Keys**  
   - Why must dictionary **keys** be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples)?  
   - What happens if you use a list or another mutable type as a key?

3. **Set Operations**  
   - Briefly describe what **union**, **intersection**, and **difference** do for sets.  
   - Provide a quick example (in plain English or pseudocode) demonstrating each operation.

## **Part B: Coding Exercises**

1. **Book Dictionary**  
   - **Task**: Create a dictionary that stores information about a **book** (e.g., `title`, `author`, `year`).  
   - Print each **key-value pair** in a formatted manner, for example, `"Title: The Great Gatsby"`.

2. **Unique Words Counter**  
   - **Task**: Prompt the user for a **sentence**.  
   - Convert the sentence to a list of words, then create a **set** from these words to find **unique** words.  
   - Print how many **unique words** there are, and optionally list them.

3. **Dictionary Update**  
   - **Task**: Write a program where you have a **dictionary** representing a person (with keys like `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"city"`).  
   - Add a new key-value pair (e.g., `"occupation": "Engineer"`) and **update** an existing value (like incrementing the `"age"` by 1).  
   - Print the updated dictionary.

4. **Set Intersection**  
   - **Task**: Take **two sets** of integers from user input (e.g., `set1` and `set2`).  
   - Compute the **intersection** (common elements) and print it.  
   - **Hint**: You can use the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator.

5. **Word Frequency**  
   - **Task**: Ask the user for a **paragraph** of text.  
   - Use a **dictionary** to count how many times each **word** appears.  
   - Print the dictionary of word counts.  
   - **Optional**: Ignore common words (e.g., “the”, “a”, “in”) or handle uppercase vs. lowercase consistently.

## **Submission Guidelines**

1. **Theory Answers**:  
   - Provide **written responses** to the questions in a text file (`.txt`, `.md`) or at the top of your `.py` files.

2. **Coding Exercises**:  
   - Submit each exercise as a separate `.py` file or as one file with **clear headings** for each exercise.  
   - Ensure your code is **well-formatted** and **commented** to explain key logic.

3. **Testing**:  
   - Run your programs to ensure there are **no errors**.  
   - If user input is required, test with different inputs to confirm your code behaves as expected.

4. **References**:  
   - Use course materials, official Python documentation, or reliable online resources for syntax guidance.

**Good luck and happy coding!** By completing these exercises, you’ll deepen your understanding of **dictionaries** and **sets**, learning how to store and manipulate data efficiently in Python. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask your instructor or classmates for help.
