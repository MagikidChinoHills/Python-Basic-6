# **Homework 4: Introduction to Conditional Statements in Python**

## **Objective**  
Learn to use **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) in Python to handle **decision-making** scenarios.

---

## **Problem 1: Basic Conditional Statements**

1. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**  
   - Write a script that **prompts** the user for an integer.  
   - Use an **`if`** statement to check if the number is **positive**.  
   - **Print** a message (e.g., `"The number is positive."`).

2. **Add an `else` Clause**  
   - Extend the previous script.  
   - If the number is **not positive**, **print** a different message (e.g., `"The number is not positive."`).

3. **Implement `elif`**  
   - Enhance your script to check if the number is **zero**.  
   - If `num == 0`, print a specific message (e.g., `"The number is zero."`).

> **Hint**: Carefully consider the **order** of conditions—when does the code check `== 0`, and when does it check `> 0` or `< 0`?

## **Problem 2: Advanced Decision-Making**

4. **Age Categorization**  
   - Create a program that asks for the user’s **age**.  
   - Use `if`, `elif`, `else` to categorize age into:
     - **0–12**: Child  
     - **13–19**: Teenager  
     - **20–59**: Adult  
     - **60+**: Senior  
   - Print a statement indicating the **category**.

5. **Voting Check**  
   - In the same program, if the user is a **teenager** **and** at least **18 years old**, print an **encouragement** to vote.  
   - Think about how to **combine** conditions (e.g., `13 <= age <= 19 and age >= 18`).

6. **Comment Your Code**  
   - Add **comments** explaining **why** you chose certain conditions and **what** your code does at each step.  
   - This helps clarify your **decision-making** process.

> **Hint**: Use **logical operators** like `and` or `or` if necessary. Also, ensure you **indent** properly to maintain readable and error-free code.

## **Additional Tips**

- **Online Resources**: Check out the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for more on conditionals.  
- **Collaboration**: Discuss ideas with classmates, but write your own code.  
- **Ask for Help**: If you get stuck or find the logic confusing, reach out to the instructor or peers.
