# **Homework 5: Lists and Tuples in Python**

## **Objective**
This homework will help you practice **theory** and **practical coding** skills related to **lists** and **tuples** in Python. You’ll answer conceptual questions, perform hands-on operations, and compare these two data structures in a short essay.

## **Part 1: Theory Questions**

1. **Terminology**
   - **List**  
   - **Tuple**  
   - **Indexing**  
   - **Mutability**  
   - **Immutability**

   > **Tip**: Think about **how** each term relates to Python’s approach to storing and organizing data. You can refer to class notes or official Python documentation for clarity.

2. **Difference Between Lists and Tuples**  
   - Explain, in **your own words**, how lists differ from tuples in **structure**, **usage**, and **limitations**.

3. **Indexing in Lists and Tuples**  
   - Describe how you **access** elements using indexing (both **positive** and **negative** indices).  
   - Provide **brief examples** to illustrate indexing in **both** lists and tuples.

## **Part 2: Coding Problems**

4. **Problem 1: List Manipulation**  
   - **Task**: Write a Python program that demonstrates:  
     1. **Creating** a list of integers.  
     2. **Appending** new elements.  
     3. **Removing** elements.  
     4. **Accessing and modifying** elements at specific indices.  
     5. **Printing** the final list.

   > **Tip**: Remember the common list methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and how to use indexing (e.g., `my_list[0]`) to read or modify an element.

5. **Problem 2: Tuple Operations**  
   - **Task**: Write a Python program that shows how tuples work by:  
     1. **Creating** a tuple of strings.  
     2. **Accessing** elements using indexing.  
     3. **Attempting** to modify an element (which should cause an error).  
     4. **Concatenating** two tuples.  
     5. **Printing** the final tuples.

   > **Tip**: Because tuples are **immutable**, you’ll see a specific type of error when you try to change an element. Think about how to handle or demonstrate that in your code.

6. **Problem 3: List vs. Tuple**  
   - **Task**: Write a **short essay** comparing and contrasting lists and tuples.  
     - Discuss **similarities** and **differences**.  
     - Provide **examples** of when you might use a list vs. a tuple.  

   > **Tip**: Consider topics like **mutability**, **performance**, **common use cases**, and the **advantages** of each.

## **Submission Guidelines**
1. **Theory Answers**:  
   - Write your responses to the theory questions in clear, concise paragraphs or bullet points.
2. **Coding Problems**:  
   - Submit your Python scripts (`.py` files). Each problem can be in a separate file or combined into one file with clear section headers.
3. **Formatting**:  
   - Ensure your code follows **proper Python syntax** and **indentation**.  
   - Include **comments** to explain key logic or clarify your approach.
4. **References**:  
   - Feel free to use class notes, official Python documentation, or reputable online resources to support your answers.
5. **Due Date**:  
   - Submit according to your instructor’s specified deadline or platform.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**

Use this homework to reinforce your understanding of **lists** and **tuples**. Don’t hesitate to experiment, practice different methods, and explore edge cases (like empty lists or single-element tuples) to deepen your learning.
