# **Homework: Basic Operations and Expressions in Python**

## **Overview**
This homework focuses on **arithmetic operations**, **comparison operators**, and **logical expressions** in Python. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to perform **calculations** and make **boolean comparisons** that drive simple decision-making in your code.

---

## **Part A: Arithmetic Operations**

1. **Rectangle Area**  
   - Create a Python file (e.g., `rectangle_area.py`).  
   - Assign variables for **length** and **width** (e.g., `length = 5`, `width = 3`).  
   - **Calculate** the area of the rectangle (length × width).  
   - **Print** the result.  
   > **Hint**: Use the `*` operator for **multiplication**.

2. **Modulus Practice**  
   - In a new file (e.g., `modulus_practice.py`), ask the user for a number.  
   - Use the **modulus** operator (`%`) to check if the number is **even** or **odd**.  
   - **Print** a message indicating the result.  
   > **Hint**: A number is **even** if `number % 2 == 0`.

## **Part B: Comparison Operators**

1. **Age Comparison**  
   - Create a file (e.g., `age_comparison.py`).  
   - Store your **age** in a variable. Store a **friend’s age** in another.  
   - Compare the two ages using **comparison operators** (`>`, `<`, `==`).  
   - **Print** statements indicating who is older or if you’re both the same age.  
   > **Hint**: You can use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to structure your comparisons, or simply print the boolean results for each comparison.

2. **Score Check**  
   - Optional: In the same or a new file, define a **score** variable (e.g., `score = 88`).  
   - Check if the score is **greater than or equal to** a certain threshold (e.g., passing grade of 70).  
   - Print whether the score indicates **"Passed"** or **"Failed"**.  
   > **Hint**: Compare with `>=` to handle equality correctly.

## **Part C: Logical Expressions**

1. **Dessert Maker**  
   - In a file (e.g., `dessert_maker.py`), create two boolean variables:
     - `has_ice_cream`  
     - `has_chocolate`  
   - Use **logical AND** (`and`) to check if you have **both** ingredients.  
   - Print whether you can make a “delicious dessert” or not.  
   > **Hint**: `True and True` is `True`; if either variable is `False`, the result is `False`.

2. **Multiple Conditions**  
   - Ask the user if they want **ice cream** and if they want **chocolate** (two separate inputs).  
   - Convert those inputs to booleans (`True` or `False`) or compare strings (e.g., `"yes"`).  
   - Print a message based on:
     - Both ingredients (`and`)  
     - One of the ingredients (`or`)  
     - Neither ingredient (`not`)

## **Additional Practice**

- **Floor Division**  
  - Use the `//` operator to perform an integer division (e.g., `15 // 4` → 3).  
  - Print the result and see how it differs from regular division (`/`).  

- **Exponentiation**  
  - Experiment with `**` for exponentiation (e.g., `2 ** 3` → 8).  
  - Print some results to see how quickly numbers grow.

## **Hints & Tips**

- **Order of Operations**: Remember that Python follows standard math precedence:  
  1. Parentheses `()`  
  2. Exponentiation `**`  
  3. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus (`*`, `/`, `//`, `%`)  
  4. Addition and Subtraction (`+`, `-`)  

- **Boolean Logic**: Practice combining multiple conditions, especially if you want to check more than two variables (e.g., `if has_ice_cream or has_cookies:`).

- **Test with Different Values**: Change your variables’ values or user inputs to confirm your code works for a variety of cases.

- **Error Messages**: If you see a syntax error or unexpected output, review your **operators** (`+`, `-`, `==`, `!=`, `and`, etc.) to ensure they’re used correctly.
