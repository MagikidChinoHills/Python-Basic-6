Lists and Tuples: Two Ways to Hold Sequences in Python
In Python, both lists and tuples serve as fundamental data structures for storing collections of items in a specific order. They share the common characteristic of being sequence types, meaning their elements are ordered and can be accessed using indexing. However, despite this similarity, lists and tuples possess key differences that dictate when each might be the more appropriate choice.

One primary similarity lies in their ability to hold a heterogeneous collection of items. Just as a list can contain integers, strings, and even other lists, so too can a tuple. Both support indexing, allowing you to retrieve elements at a particular position using square brackets (e.g., my_list[0], my_tuple[1]). Furthermore, you can iterate through the elements of both lists and tuples using loops.

The most significant difference between lists and tuples lies in their mutability. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list. 1  This dynamic nature makes lists highly versatile for situations where the collection of items might evolve over time. For example, you might use a list to store the names of students in a class, where students can be added or removed. Similarly, tracking the items in a shopping cart would be well-suited for a list, as items can be added, removed, or their quantities adjusted.
