## **Section 1: Vocabulary and Definitions**

### Instructions:
For each of the following terms, follow the steps below:

1. Define the term in your own words.
2. Demonstrate the concept with a Python function of your own design.
3. Briefly describe how this concept is applied in programming.

### Terms:

1. **Function**
2. **Parameter**
3. **Argument**
4. **Return Statement**
5. **Scope**
6. **Local Scope**
7. **Global Scope**
8. **Recursive Function**
9. **Default Parameter**

## **Section 2: Practice Problems**

### **Basic Problems**

1. **Create and Call a Function**:
   - Write a function named `greet` that takes no arguments and prints "Hello, World!" when called.

2. **Function with Parameters**:
   - Write a function named `multiply` that accepts two numbers as parameters and prints their product.

3. **Using Return Statements**:
   - Write a function named `square` that takes a single number as an argument and returns its square.

4. **Global and Local Scope**:
   - Create a global variable named `counter` and write a function that increases its value by 1 each time the function is called.

5. **Recursive Function**:
   - Write a recursive function named `countdown` that takes a number as an argument and prints a countdown from that number to 1.

---

## **Section 3: Intermediate Problems**

1. **Default Parameters**:
   - Write a function named `greet_user` that takes a parameter `name` with a default value of "User." The function should print a personalized greeting.

2. **Multiple Return Values**:
   - Write a function named `get_min_max` that accepts a list of numbers and returns the smallest and largest numbers in the list.

3. **Using Lists in Functions**:
   - Write a function named `filter_even` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

4. **String Manipulation**:
   - Write a function named `reverse_string` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

## **Section 4: Advanced Problems with Hints and Tips**

### Problem 1: Factorial Calculation

**Task**: Write a recursive function named `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a given number.

**Hint**: The factorial of 0 is 1. For all other numbers, \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \).

---

### Problem 2: Palindrome Check

**Task**: Write a function named `is_palindrome` that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Return `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

**Hint**: Use slicing or loops to reverse the string and compare it with the original.

---

### Problem 3: Fibonacci Sequence

**Task**: Write a recursive function named `fibonacci` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

**Hint**: The sequence starts with 0, 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

---

### Problem 4: Exponent Function

**Task**: Implement a function named `power` that calculates \( base^{exponent} \) using recursion.

**Hint**: Multiply the base by itself \( exponent \) times. Use a base case where \( exponent = 0 \).

---

### Problem 5: Advanced Scope Problem

**Task**: Write a function named `nested_function_example` that demonstrates the use of a local variable, a global variable, and a nested function. Ensure the nested function modifies a local variable and the global variable.

**Hint**: Define a global variable outside the main function and update it inside the nested function.
